# Density-of-States-for-FHI-AIMS
Python program to plot the Density of States (DOS) from FHI-AIMS outputs.

# Needed Files
The necessary input files are:
  1.  geometry.in
  2.  KS_DOS_total.dat
  3.  atom_proj_dos_*.dat or atom_proj_dos_spin_*.dat

The input files must contain the atom projected DOS, *NOT* the specie projected DOS given that the last one is an average DOS per atom.

# Instructions
This program must be runned in the same directory as the input files.
The use of this program is very simple
1.  
x. The user must specify whether the system is spin polarized or not following the screen-displayed instructions
2.
